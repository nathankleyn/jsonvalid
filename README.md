# JSON Valid [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nathankleyn/jsonvalid.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/nathankleyn/jsonvalid) [![Crates.io Version Of jsonvalid](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/jsonvalid.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/jsonvalid)

Validate JSON files for syntax mistakes using a static binary that can be easily distributed!

## Install

You can download the latest release of JSON Valid from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nathankleyn/jsonvalid/releases). Make sure to pick the appropriate static binary for your architecture.

If an architecture of your choice is not available, or you want to compile the latest code, you can do a simple `cargo build --release` in the cloned out version of this repository to get a binary (only stable Rust is required).

## Usage

```
➜  jsonvalid --help
JSON Valid 0.1.0
Nathan Kleyn <nathan@nathankleyn.com>
Checks whether JSON is valid and well-formed.

USAGE:
    jsonvalid [FILE]...

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

ARGS:
    <FILE>...    files to validate; if none are given, it will read from stdin instead
```

## Examples

### Using STDIN

JSON Valid will accept input via STDIN, exiting silently if there are no errors:

```sh
➜  echo '{ "foo": "bar" }' | jsonvalid
➜  echo $?
0
```

If there is an error, you will see detailed information as to where it occurred:

```sh
➜  echo '{ "foo": "bar"' | jsonvalid
# => Error in JSON: EOF while parsing an object at line 2 column 0
➜  echo $?
1
```

### Using paths to files

We can also use files instead of STDIN:

```sh
➜  echo '{ "foo": "bar" }' > valid.json
➜  echo '{ "foo": "bar"' > invalid.json
```

If we pass a valid file, we see the same successful, silent exit:

```sh
➜  jsonvalid valid.json
➜  echo $?
0
```

Similarly, an invalid file shows us the cause:

```sh
➜  jsonvalid invalid.json
# => Error in file invalid.json: EOF while parsing an object at line 2 column 0
➜  echo $?
1
```

We can also pass many files. If any of the files is invalid, the whole command fails:

```sh
➜  jsonvalid valid.json invalid.json
# => Error in file invalid.json: EOF while parsing an object at line 2 column 0
➜  echo $?
1
```

## Background

I wanted a way to easily validate the well-formedness of JSON files without the following:

* Obvious syntax errors being allowed (rules out [`jq`](https://github.com/stedolan/jq), which fails silently with unbalanced braces in <= v1.5).
* Does not require a runtime or package system to install (rules out [`jsonlint`](npmjs.com/package/jsonlint), which is currently broken and unmaintained anyway!)
* Does not require me to know about the contents of the JSON (rules out anything that is using JSON schema to achieve the above goals).

Thus, JSON Valid was born!
